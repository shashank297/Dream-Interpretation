"Chris was ordering difficult food items ‘bison wings’. Then I couldn’t find him. he was up in the bathroom eating wings alone. Then we wake up and he makes a comment about my body. I felt mad and embaressed. He was not apologitic. So I stormed out of the room and I knew he packed his bags and left. I was in a wheelchair for the whole dream. Then I went to a museum, went with family and saw my old high teacher who was the only person who made me cry. The teacher was giving grades then he gave me a 100%, but then the next person he gives them a 110% and is then inviting people to his house, but then I asked why I wasn’t invited and not supposed to hear it. Then I am mad at everyone, I wheel myself to the mall. I was very angry in my dream”","Dream Interpretation:

Response: Dreams are highly personal and subjective, so interpretations can vary. However, I can offer a possible interpretation of your dream:

The ""bison wings"" that Chris is ordering could symbolize a difficult or unconventional choice or situation that you are facing. Your inability to find him and his subsequent eating of the wings alone may represent a sense of isolation or feeling unseen or unheard in a relationship or situation. The comment he makes about your body could be a trigger for feelings of insecurity or inadequacy. Your reaction of anger and embarrassment may indicate that you are feeling vulnerable and sensitive about these issues. His lack of apology could symbolize a perceived lack of empathy or understanding from those around you. The act of storming out of the room and his subsequent departure could reflect a desire for distance or separation from the situation or relationship.

Being in a wheelchair for the whole dream could represent feelings of immobility or powerlessness. Visiting the museum with your family and encountering your old high school teacher who made you cry may suggest that you are seeking comfort or support from those who have been important to you. The teacher giving you a 100% grade but then giving someone else a 110% and inviting them to his house could reflect feelings of inadequacy or comparison to others. Not being invited and not being supposed to hear it could indicate a sense of exclusion or disappointment. Your anger and the act of wheeling yourself to the mall may symbolize a determination to overcome obstacles and assert your independence.

Overall, the dream could be a reflection of your current emotional state and the challenges you are facing in your relationships and personal growth. It may be worthwhile to explore these emotions and consider how they relate to your real-life experiences and goals."
